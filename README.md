# Luganda Speech Intent Recognition For IoT Applications

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Luganda Speech Intent Classification project. This project aims to develop a Luganda speech intent classification system for IoT applications, enabling users to interact with smart home devices using the Luganda language.

## Dataset
We have collected a dataset of Luganda voice commands to train and evaluate our speech intent recognition model. You can access the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VZafFJz1qE2QPwIevf27HjWYg5_485y-?usp=sharing).
